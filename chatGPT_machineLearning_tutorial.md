#### This is a tutorial from the vedio creater Dave Ebbelaar. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmQiLvnY3WY&t=2s) 
#### You can use chatgpt to do the machine learning work and run model to forecast value you want.
#### Make sure that you have a proper Python enviroment that can use for this tutorial.
#### This tutorial by using chatgpt to do machine learning work will follow by Data Science Lifecycle

Step 1
  --Open the link and download the dataset already created : https://docs.datalumina.io/bJhyeJ4lHG...  
  
Step 2
  --Open an empty Python file that in source "Data", put dataset into VS code 
  
Step 3
  --give chatGPT the senario and business questions that you want to solve by asking to give you a python code using Pandas into a dataframe. 
  
  --In this case, for example: A company that rents our bikes that will be rented out on a given day. The model will tabke into account varuious factors such as the date(month, day, whether it is a holiday or weekend), as well as weather data(temperature, precipitation, etc.) to make accurate predictions about bike rental demand. This will help the company to better plan for staffing and bike inventory, and optimize revenue. Can you write python for me that can read this csv using Pandas into a datafram?
